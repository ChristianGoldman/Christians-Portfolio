                <p>
                    Welcome to Christian Goldmans portfolio webpage! I am a 27 year old construction worker, who specializes in steel stud framing, sheetrocking, scaffold building, acoustical ceilings, and various finish jobs (trim, hanging doors, cabinets, etc...). I've been in the construction field for 9 years. Started off doing concrete work when I was 18 years old,
                    working for a small company of only 3 people, myself included. Worked with that company for 2 years before joining the Carpenters Union (Local 322). My first job as an apprentice Carpenter
                    was a scaffold builder at the Koch oil Refinery in Rosemount, MN. I learned a lot and saw a lot of cool things. When stands out the most to me in terms of what I learned. Was the ability to problem
                    solve, and be creative with different ways one specific job could be completed. There are a lot of Construction workers in the world that believe their way is the only right way and everyone elses approach was inefficient and just plain wrong.
                    Its been my experience, working with those kinds of people, tend to bring team morale down and cause alot of unnecessary friction in the work place, slowing the entire project down.
                    After working at the Koch Refinery for just about 2 years, I switched companys to work with Construction Results Co. Construction Results is whats known as a General Contractor. As a GC they take almost any and every job they could get their hands on.
                    One day I would be steel stud framing, and the next I'd be Glueing Fire retardent panels to walls. Construction Results allowed me to become a very well rounded carpenter. I was good at alot but master of none.
                    I worked with Construction Results for 4 years before deciding to move on to more specialized type of work. The Berg Group was next on the list for me. They speciallized is steel stud framing and sheetrocking exclusively.
                    As I mentioned before I was good at alot but masters of none. The Carpenters at The Berg Group were all MASTERS at their craft. I had to work twice as hard as the other carpenters to keep up in pace.
                    It was a very humbling experience and gave me a new found love for the craft. The biggest complaint I had with construction was that it took more muscle than it took brain power. The Berg Group completely changed
                    my outlook on construction. You either learn how to be the most effecient version of yourself or you will get left in the dust. Nobody can keep up with these carpenters at the Berg Group is you aren't willing to learn
                    and adapt how you think and how you go about doing your job. I was amazed how widely your approach to each job varried even though you were completing the same task day in and day out.
                    I've learned a lot from that company and love what I'm doing, but I am excited to begin a new careeer as a computer programmer. If I can take my work ethic, problem solving ability, and willingness to adapt
                    the sky is the limit for me and I couldn't be more excited!

                    What I do for fun outside of work, mainly involves basketball, Video games with my buddies, Softball, construction sidejobs, and Fishing.
                    I love watching the Timberwolve's games with some buddies, even though the T-Wolves are legendary bad (10-10-2020). I date that statement so hopefully I can come back to this
                    webpage in a couple years and laugh about all the pain and suffereing they have brought me these past 27 years of my life LOL. SKOL Vikings!
